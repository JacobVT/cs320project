# CS 320 - Final Project (Minecraft Item Crafter)
### Created By: Jacob van Tol, Noah Scarbrough, and Jared Kangas

## Description
Minecraft Item Crafter is a web app that gives users the ability to experiment with Minecraft crafting recipes. Recipes are patterns of items, typically arranged in a 3x3 grid, that combine to create a new item. The user can add items to a 3x3 table and the software will scan for valid recipes. If a valid recipe is detected, the resulting item is displayed to the user. To make crafting easier, the app also contains a searchable list of all items.

## Current Phase: *Testing*
