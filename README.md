# CS 320 - Final Project (Minecraft Item Crafter)
### Created By: Jacob van Tol, Noah Scarbrough, and Jared Kangas

## Description
Minecraft Item Crafter is a web app that allows users to experiment with Minecraft crafting recipes. Recipes are a pattern of items in a 3x3 table that result in a new item. The user will be able to populate a 3x3 table, and the software will scan for valid recipes. If a valid recipe is detected, it will display the resulting item to the user.  

This app is intended to allow users to experiment with crafting without wasting in-game materials.
